My projects that I've built as part of my FreeCodeCamp "Data Analysis with Python" course.


I learnt how to read data from a variety of sources such as CSVs, SQL, Excel and HTML. I also learnt how to clean and process data using NumPy and Pandas, visualize it with Matplotlib and Seaborn. I was able to learn new skills and become more comfortable with the Python Data Analysis and Visualization toolbox by using the course notebooks and completing these tasks.


Upon completion of the course requirements, I obtained a "Data Analysis with Python" Developer Certification, representing approximately 300 hours of coursework.
